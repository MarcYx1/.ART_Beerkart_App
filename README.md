## TODO:
    - Serial connection
    - Option to save sampled data
    - IDK yet but if we need to sample multiple data at once, multiple graphs at once, maybe when pressing live graph the user should be able to choose the graph he wants to open?
    - The entire sampler script, which includes serial connection (TOP PRIORITY)
    - Heartbeat indicator
